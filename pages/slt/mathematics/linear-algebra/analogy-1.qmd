## 1. **Matrix Multiplication – The Outfit Designer Story**


> *You’re helping a school design outfits for different events: sports day, annual day, and farewell. You have shirts, pants, and shoes in different colors.*  

 
> “We can think of the clothes as numbers in a list — like a vector — and the outfit designer’s plan as a matrix.”  

Let’s define:  
$\text{Vector of available clothes:} v = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

(where 2 shirts, 3 pants, and 1 pair of shoes are available).  

And the *style matrix* for creating different outfits:  
$M = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\   % sports outfit
0 & 1 & 1 \\   % annual day outfit
1 & 1 & 0      % farewell outfit
\end{bmatrix}$

- Row 1 = Sports outfit uses 1 shirt + 0 pant + 1 shoe.  
- Row 2 = Annual outfit uses 0 shirt + 1 pant + 1 shoe.  
- Row 3 = Farewell outfit uses 1 shirt + 1 pant + 0 shoe.  

**Matrix multiplication:**  
$M \times v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 3 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
(1×2 + 0×3 + 1×1) \\ 
(0×2 + 1×3 + 1×1) \\ 
(1×2 + 1×3 + 0×1)
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\ 4 \\ 5
\end{bmatrix}
$

 
> “This means we can make 3 sports outfits, 4 annual day outfits, and 5 farewell outfits. The matrix acted like a recipe book that transformed our list of clothes into finished outfits.”

## 2. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues – The Stretchy Line Story**

 
> *Imagine you draw lines on a rubber sheet — one horizontal, one diagonal. Now you stretch the sheet by pulling it rightward.*  


> “Some lines will twist and tilt, but one or two special lines won’t turn direction; they only get longer or shorter.”  

We can represent the transformation as:  
$A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

This means x-values are doubled, but y-values stay the same.

For a vector along the x-axis:  
$v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$

then  

$A v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = 2 v_1$

Thus, $v_1$ doesn’t change direction — only its length doubles. Its **eigenvalue** is $2$.  

For a vector along the y-axis:  
$v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
then  
$A.v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 1 v_2$

Here, the direction stays the same, and the **eigenvalue** is $1$.  

**Teacher explains:**  
> “The eigenvectors are the lines that don’t rotate when stretched, only change in size. The eigenvalues tell how much each line grows or shrinks.”

## 3. **Dimensionality Reduction – The Shadow Story**


> *You have a 3D toy (a cube) lit by a lamp. Its shadow falls on the wall — a 2D picture that keeps most of the cube’s shape.*  


> “When we look at the shadow, we’re reducing a 3D object to 2D, keeping its most important features.”  

Let’s imagine three points on the cube in 3D space:

$P_1 = (1, 2, 3), \quad P_2 = (2, 3, 4), \quad P_3 = (3, 5, 6)$

To project onto a 2D plane (ignore the z-axis):

$\text{Projection matrix } 
P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$

Then:

$P \times 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
P \times
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 3 \\ 4
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
P \times
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\ 5 \\ 6
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\ 5
\end{bmatrix}$

> “The shadow keeps the main structure — how points relate — but loses some details (depth). That’s exactly what dimensionality reduction like PCA does: it keeps the most useful parts and drops unnecessary ones.”
